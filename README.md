# White-Matter-Functional-Connectivity

These scripts perform K-means clustering of white matter voxels based on BOLD-fMRI within white matter voxels.
Ps: These scripts require Matlab and SPM (https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) to be installed.

This method has been used in schizophrenia [1] and epilepsy [2].
